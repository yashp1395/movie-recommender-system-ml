# Project: Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!

# About this project:

This is a streamlit web application that can recommend various kinds of similar movies based on an user interest.
here is a demo,

# Concept used to build the model.pkl file : cosine_similarity

1 . Cosine Similarity is a metric that allows you to measure the similarity of the documents.

2 . In order to demonstrate cosine similarity function we need vectors. Here vectors are numpy array.

3 . Finally, Once we have vectors, We can call cosine_similarity() by passing both vectors. It will calculate the cosine similarity between these two.

4 . It will be a value between [0,1]. If it is 0 then both vectors are complete different. But in the place of that if it is 1, It will be completely similar.
